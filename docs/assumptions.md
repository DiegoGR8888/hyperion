# Model Assumptions

## Physiological Scope
- The model focuses on cerebral oxygen availability.
- Only healthy adult humans are considered.
- No pathological conditions are modeled.

## Core Variables
- Initial oxygen saturation (SpO2)
- Heart rate
- Activity level
- Oxygen consumption rate

## Simplifications
- Linear oxygen consumption
- Constant cerebral metabolic demand
- No adaptive physiological responses

## Ethical Disclaimer
This model is a computational research tool and must not be used for medical
decision-making or real-world safety assessments.
