# HYPERION

HYPERION is a computational biomedicine research project focused on modeling
human cerebral tolerance to hypoxia using physiologically grounded simulations
and machine learning techniques.

## Project Scope
This project aims to simulate oxygen dynamics and estimate time-to-risk
thresholds for loss of consciousness under hypoxic conditions. The system is
designed for research and educational purposes only.

## Disclaimer
This project does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment
recommendations. It is not intended for clinical use.

## Status
Project initialization and physiological modeling phase.
